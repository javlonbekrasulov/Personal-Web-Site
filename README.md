## 1. Landing Page
The landing page is the first impression visitors get.  
It contains my profile picture, name, and essential details, arranged in a way that’s easy to read and visually balanced.  

Two main buttons — **“About Me”** and **“Contact Info”** — guide visitors directly to relevant sections.  
Additionally, Telegram and GitHub icons are provided for quick access to my messaging and coding platforms.  

This page focuses on giving visitors a clear overview in seconds.  
The layout is clean, avoiding unnecessary text so that users can instantly decide where to navigate next.

A photograph adds a personal touch, making the page feel more engaging.  
This section also briefly covers my technical skills and interests.  

It is designed to help others understand who I am beyond just certificates and projects, offering a personal connection for potential collaborators or recruiters.

## 3. Achievements
The **Achievements** page highlights my milestones in two categories:
- **Language Proficiency**
- **Coding Achievements**

This feature builds trust, showing proof of my skills without requiring additional requests from visitors.  

The page layout ensures achievements are clearly separated, allowing users to focus on either languages or coding without distraction.  
This organization makes it easy for visitors to quickly find what they are most interested in.

Every link is clickable and takes users straight to the intended destination, reducing unnecessary steps.

The navigation bar is responsive, automatically adjusting its layout for different screen sizes.  
On smaller screens, it changes shape to maximize space, ensuring mobile users get the same smooth experience as desktop visitors.

## 6. Design Choices
The website follows a **minimalistic approach**, with emphasis on clarity and ease of use.  
Every color, font, and spacing choice is intentional — aimed at keeping the content readable and the interface professional.  

This style makes it accessible even to visitors who are not experienced in browsing personal websites.
